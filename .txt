Edge Case 

couldnt read property of undefined
Error - Returned undefined for damageType

solved - console.log(response.data) 
return undefined error 

Investigate data 
Discovered edge case - Not all spells deal damage

Solution = Validation with if statement 

// checks if value was instantiated 
!== undefined

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined Object (reading 'spells' of that undefined object)
